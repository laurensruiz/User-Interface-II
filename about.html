    <h1> ABOUT </h1>
    <p>The website doesn't have the theme I was going for. 

        Something summery; colorful. This looks perfect. Just Photoshop out the dog, add a baby, and make the curtains blue. We also need to add this 2000 line essay. Can the black be darker? Can you make it stand out more? I know you've made thirty iterations, but can we go back to the first one? That was the best version I remember. I'll know it when I see it; thatâ€™s not what I saw in my head at all. Can you put "find us on facebook" by the facebook logo?</p>
